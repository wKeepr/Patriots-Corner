# Patriot's-Corner
Welcome to #AmericanExceptionalism Row.
We love the Founder's USA. 
_They had a clear vision obtained by biblical knowledge and doctrine and came to a land where true freedom could be planted in seeds of prosperity._
*Those doctrines and the understandings they gained freed them to recreate in a nation the designs of Him in whose image they were made a country like never in history had been done.*
Join us in this great discovery, won't you?
